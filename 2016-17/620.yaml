  Additional Requirements:
    message: |
      Either SPAN 313 or SPAN 314 is required.

      Additionally, you must take one (1) additional on-campus level III
      course, and three (3) electives above the 250 level.

      Of these five (5) courses, at least one must focus on Spain, and one on
      Latin America.

      Level III courses may be repeated as long as a different topic is
      offered each time.

      Courses from abroad or from other U.S. institutions count as 270-level
      electives.
