    message: >
      This requirement is usually an academic, credit-bearing experience
      completed during the senior year (including the previous summer.) It is
      designed to ensure that concentrators participate in an experience that
      applies basic family knowledge (theories, frameworks, concepts) to real
      families in a setting beyond the classroom. It must be approved by a
      faculty member in the Department of Social Work and Family Studies prior
      to enrollment and entered into the Department GoogleDoc. The experience
      and concomitant learning is presented as a graded assignment for a
      public audience in the senior seminar FAMST 391. Through the experience,
      students demonstrate attainment of intended learning outcomes for family
      studies.
