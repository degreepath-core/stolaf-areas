          Two courses focused upon any single contemporary world region or
          country (e.g., Africa, Asia, China, Germany, Japan, Latin America,
          the Middle East, or Russia).

          The courses can be from any department and may include courses
          completed in approved St. Olaf off-campus programs.

          percent of the course content dedicated to target country or region.
